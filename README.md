### A multivendor fork of Snapmaker Orca FullSpectrum — Mixed-Color Filament Support + direct LAN printing

**Version 0.1.0-mvp (experimental).** Besides everything from Snapmaker Orca
FullSpectrum (mixed-color filaments, Local-Z, tool ordering, prime tower), this
fork adds direct LAN printing on stock firmware — no cloud account required:

| Printer | Backend | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Anycubic Kobra 3 (LAN Mode) | `anycubic_lan` | experimental — protocol implemented from community docs, not yet hardware-validated in this fork |
| FlashForge Adventurer 5M / 5M Pro | `flashforge_lan` | experimental — protocol implemented from community docs, not yet hardware-validated in this fork |
| All existing backends (OctoPrint, Moonraker, Duet, MKS, Obico, …) | unchanged | preserved |

See [docs/MVP_MULTIVENDOR.md](docs/MVP_MULTIVENDOR.md) for setup (LAN Mode,
IP/CheckCode), architecture, security notes and known limitations. This fork
uses its own configuration directory (`OrcaSlicer_FullSpectrum`) and does not
touch Snapmaker Orca or OrcaSlicer installs.

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER** ⚠️

**This fork is currently in active development and has been tested on actual hardware.**

- **Use at Your Own Risk**: As with any slicer fork, please review critical prints and generated G-code before production use
- **Project Compatibility Warning**: Some `.3mf` files created with older FullSpectrum builds may not open or migrate cleanly in newer versions because mixed-filament data and project serialization have changed over time

**Snapmaker Orca FullSpectrum** is an open source slicer for FDM printers based on Snapmaker Orca and OrcaSlicer, optimized for Snapmaker's U1 multi-color 3D printer with independent tool heads. This fork adds support for virtual mixed-color filaments, enabling you to create new colors by alternating layers between physical filaments.

# Features

## Mixed-Color Filaments
Snapmaker Orca FullSpectrum includes support for **virtual mixed-color filaments** designed for the Snapmaker U1 multi-color printer with independent print heads.

### How It Works
- **Create new colors by mixing**: Combine two physical filaments to create a new color appearance through layer alternation
- **Example**: One layer of red + one layer of green = apparent yellow color
- **Customizable ratios**: Adjust the alternation pattern (e.g., 2:1 ratio = two layers of filament A, one layer of filament B)

### Features
- Automatic generation of all possible color combinations from your loaded filaments
- Visual preview showing the additive color blend
- Enable/disable individual mixed filaments
- Per-layer resolution control with customizable ratios
- Optional per-pair Bias control for slightly recessing one component to push the apparent color toward the other
- Seamless integration with the existing filament management system

### Using Mixed Filaments
1. Load 2 or more physical filaments in your printer
2. The "Mixed Colors" panel will automatically appear in the sidebar
3. Each combination shows:
   - Color preview swatch
   - Component filaments (e.g., "Filament 1 + Filament 2")
   - Layer ratio controls (spin controls for fine-tuning)
   - Enable/disable checkbox
4. Mixed filaments can be assigned to objects just like physical filaments
5. During slicing, the mixed filament resolves to alternating layers of its components

### Bias Control
Snapmaker Orca FullSpectrum also includes an optional **Bias** control for mixed filament pairs. When enabled in **Print Settings -> Others -> Mixed Filaments**, each mixed row gets a compact inline Bias value:

- **Positive Bias** recesses the second filament in the pair
- **Negative Bias** recesses the first filament in the pair
- This lets you shift the apparent color without changing the nominal layer cadence
- The inline preview updates to show the estimated apparent mix shift

Example: for a pair like `F1 + F2`, a positive bias makes `F2` sit slightly lower, so `F1` visually dominates more. A negative bias does the opposite and recesses `F1`.

### Dithering Settings
Snapmaker Orca FullSpectrum includes advanced dithering controls to fine-tune the layer alternation behavior for mixed filaments. These settings are found in **Others → Dithering** in the print settings:

#### Dithering Cadence Height A & B
- **What it does**: Controls the height (in mm) of each alternating segment for the two component filaments
- **Cadence Height A**: The height of layers using the first filament in the mix
- **Cadence Height B**: The height of layers using the second filament in the mix
- **Example**: Setting A=0.3mm and B=0.15mm creates a 2:1 ratio pattern where you get twice as much of filament A as filament B
- **Use case**: Fine-tune color intensity by adjusting the relative amounts of each component color

#### Dithering Step Size
- **What it does**: Defines the Z-height increment (in mm) for each dithering step
- **Purpose**: Controls the resolution of the layer alternation pattern
- **Default**: Typically matches your layer height setting
- **Advanced usage**: Set smaller values for smoother color transitions, or larger values for more distinct color banding
- **Compatibility**: Must be compatible with your printer's Z-axis resolution

These settings give you precise control over how your mixed colors appear in the final print, allowing you to achieve different visual effects from the same filament combinations.

### Technical Details
- Virtual filament IDs start after physical filaments (e.g., with 4 physical filaments, first mixed ID is 5)
- Layer-based alternation is computed during tool ordering
- Works with all existing features: supports, infill, and multi-material painting
